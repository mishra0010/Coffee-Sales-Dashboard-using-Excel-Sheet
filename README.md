# Coffee Sales Analysis with Excel

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing coffee sales data using Microsoft Excel. The goal was to consolidate data from multiple sources, perform in-depth analysis, and present the findings in a dynamic and interactive dashboard. By leveraging Excelâ€™s advanced functions and features, this project provides insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and regional preferences.

## Objectives

1. **Data Consolidation**: 
   - Gather data from multiple Excel sheets (Customer, Item, and Order) and consolidate it into a single order sheet for comprehensive analysis.

2. **Data Formatting & Analysis**:
   - Clean and format the data to prepare it for analysis.
   - Create a Pivot Table to summarize and analyze key metrics.

3. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Develop a dynamic dashboard featuring various charts and interactive elements to visualize coffee sales data.

## Steps and Methodology

### 1. Data Consolidation
   - **VLOOKUP**: Used to match and retrieve data from different sheets. This function allowed for merging information such as customer details and item specifics into a single order sheet.
   - **INDEX and MATCH**: Implemented these functions for more flexible data lookups, providing an efficient way to search for and reference data across multiple sheets.

### 2. Data Formatting & Analysis
   - **Data Cleaning**: Formatted the consolidated data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
   - **Pivot Table Creation**: Developed a Pivot Table to aggregate and summarize the data, which served as the foundation for the analysis and visualization.

### 3. Dashboard Creation
   - **Charts**: Created three primary charts:
     - **Total Sales Over Time**: Visualizes sales trends across different time periods.
     - **Top 5 Customers**: Highlights the top five customers based on their total purchases.
     - **Sales by Country**: Shows sales distribution across different countries.
   - **Time Series Analysis**: Incorporated a Time Series chart to track changes in sales over time.
   - **Slicers**: Added three interactive Slicers (Roast Type Name, Size, Loyalty Card) to allow users to filter and view data dynamically.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Dashboard**: The dashboard updates in real-time based on user interactions with slicers and time series controls.
- **Interactive Charts**: Users can interact with charts to explore detailed insights and trends.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Provides a detailed view of sales performance, customer behavior, and regional preferences.

## Key Learning Points
